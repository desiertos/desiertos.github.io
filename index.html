            <h1>Here comes the story of the Hurricane</h1>

            <p>
                Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
                Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
                She sees a bartender in a pool of blood
                Cries out my God, they killed them all
                Here comes the story of the Hurricane
                The man the authorities came to blame
                For somethin' that he never done
                Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
                The champion of the world
            </p>

            <p>
                Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
                And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
                I didn't do it, he says, and he throws up his hands
                I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
                I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
                One of us had better call up the cops
                And so Patty calls the cops
                And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
                In the hot New Jersey night
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
                Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
                Number one contender for the middleweight crown
                Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
                When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
                Just like the time before and the time before that
                In Paterson that's just the way things go
                If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
                'Less you want to draw the heat
